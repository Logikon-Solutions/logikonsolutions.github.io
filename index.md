<h2 class="typewriter gold-link">Data Scientist | Researcher | Engineer</h2>

I'm a data scientist, risk analyst, and engineer based in Utrecht, The Netherlands. I specialize in utilizing data-driven methods to tackle complex decision-making challenges. I currently work as a researcher and consultant at Deltares, and I’ve developed open-source tools and models focused on reinforcement learning, statistical inference, and decision-making under uncertainty for engineering infrastructure assets.
